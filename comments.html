                <h3 class="comments-sub-title">Reflection</h3>
                <p>I believe the design of my website is appealing to the eye, however could also be a little more organised as I believe the structure of the site can feel a bit cluttered at times. I also feel as though the homepage screen is too simple and empty with nothing in particular to catch the user's attention unlike the one in <a id="other-ul" href="https://rymedy.github.io/" target="_blank" attribute>my current portfolio</a>. In the future I would likely attempt to utilise JavaScript and more CSS animations in order to implement a more interactive design.</p>
                <h3 class="comments-sub-title">Technical Aspects</h3>
                <p>The use of an HTML lists were used for the navigation bars at the top of every HTML page, however these lists were styled so that the "list-style-type" property was set to "none" in order to remove the dot points of the list. I also set the position of the list to sticky to ensure the list (nav-bar) was at the top of the page, then added padding to the list items to add space between the a tags, including the links to the "About Me", "Past", "Future", "Comments" and "GitHub" HTML pages. The homepage of the index.html file also contains a div with the id, "start-screen-container" that covers the top half of the viewport which has padding all around the div and includes the introduction, "Hi there. I'm Richar...etc." and an image of a figure on a laptop which both have their positions set to "absolute" within the container in order to allow me to place them whereever I wanted within the div using the "top" and "left" CSS attributes. The div on each HTML page with the class, "page-content" sets the width of the div to 75%. Within these divs I include the information for each of the pages within another 2 divs one with the class, "page-content" and another with the class, "page-content-inverted". The div with the "page-content" div offsets the content toward the left of the screen using more padding on the right side of the div, while the div with the class, "page-content-inverted" offsets the content toward the right side of the screen by using more padding on the left side of the div. The website is also responsive to multiple screen sizes by utilising percentage values rather than pixel values when defining width and heights of divs and contents of the webpages.</p>
                <h3 class="comments-sub-title">Aesthetics</h3>
                <p>Within my webpage I attempted to achieve a simplistic design, however I believe the aesthetics of the page is too disorganised. However, I do believe users will appreciate the neat HTML details present within each HTML page such as the faded &lt;past&gt;, &lt;future&gt; text etc. in the background. I also utilised the text-shadow css attribute to create the 3D effect on some of the text within the webpage to place emphasise on some of the text throughout the webpages. I also believe the buttons under the projects section of the past.html page are interactive as they utilise the "transition" and "box-shadow" CSS attributes to ease-out the change in the "box-shadow" attribute's properties on hover. I also set the "text-align" css attribute of text associated with the "page-content" class to the center instead of the left for a neater layout. I also utilised the "writing-mode" and "text-orientation" CSS attributes in order to write the text with the id, "japanese-text" down the page instead of across the page.</p>
                <h3 class="comments-sub-title">Accessibility</h3>
                <p>The webpages are extremely accessible and anyone regardless of their disabilities can access and interact with my webpage as the use of contrasting colors including white and bright red text on dark blue background as a theme on my webpages allow for a user-friendly experience. The use of the clear, easy to read Verdana font and large text, especially on titles to emphasise different sections of my webpage also further emphasise its accessibility to anyone regardless of their disability. The webpages can also be accessed without using the mouse and only the keyboard by using keyboard shortcuts such as space to scroll down, shift+space to scroll up, shift and tab to change the focus to the next and previous link to different webpages and enter to "click" on these links.</p>
