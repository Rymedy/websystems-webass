                <h3 class="comments-sub-title">Reflection</h3>
                <p>I believe my website is aesthetically appealing due to close detail to design, however the design of the webpage could have been planned prior to development in order to ensure a more structured website experience. Additionally, the lack of elements within the div identified by "start-screen-container" also does not hold up to the design standards upheld by the remainder of the website and lacks aesthetic appeal in comparison to the one featured in <a id="other-ul" href="https://rymedy.github.io/" target="_blank">my current portfolio</a>.</p>
                <p>In the future, I plan to increase my integration and usage of JavaScript and CSS animations to enhance interactivity within my website to improve the overall user experience.</p>
                <h3 class="comments-sub-title">Technical Aspects</h3>
                <p>Throughout my HTML pages I utilised lists to create navigation bars at the top of every HTML page. These lists were encased within a div with id "top-navbar" with the "margin" property set to auto in order to center the navigation bar and their "style-type" CSS property's have been set to none in order to effectively remove the bullet points. The "position" CSS attribute of the list was set to sticky in order to ensure the navigation bar was always positioned at the top of each HTML page. The "padding" attribute was also used to form space between the list items that encase the anchor tags to the other pages including "About Me", "Past", "Future", Comments", and "GitHub".</p>
                <p>Furthermore, the index.html file showcases a div with id, "start-screen-container" that occupies the top-half of the viewport by utilising the "padding" CSS attribute. This div displays a welcome screen which encases an image of a figure on a laptop and a concise introduction about myself, which both have their "position" attribute set to "absolute" to allow for manipulation of the "top" and "left" CSS attributes, ultimately allowing for the free placements of the child HTML elements within the div.</p>
                <p>The HTML pages incorporate div with the class "page-content" which act as containers for the crucial information of the webpage. These div's held two child divs: one with the class "page-section" which have their widths set to '60%' with more padding on the right side to ensure the div is offset on the left and another with the class "page-section-inverted" which has more padding on the left side in order to offset the div to the right of the HTML page.</p>
                <p>The website also achieves responsiveness across different screen sizes by the usage of percentage values rather than pixel values to define the width's and heights of HTML elements and containers to ensure a consistent user interface.</p>
                <h3 class="comments-sub-title">Aesthetics</h3>
                <p>Throughout the development and design of the webpage I attempted to achieve a minimalistic aesthetic by utilising a limited color scheme that included dark shades of bright red and dark blue. This color palette also contrasts against each other in order to both look more appealing to the user and increase accessibility for those with disabilities. In the webpage I have also utilised HTML elements and CSS styling in order to create an organised appeal by including large faded text in the background that subconciously label and emphasise the subtitles of the different sections.</p>
                <p>Furthermore, I have utilised the "text-shadow" CSS attribute in order to form three-dimensional text throughout the webpage that further incorporates the color scheme and emphasises vital components beyond a basic header tag. I also included buttons under the project section of the past.html page which features links to projects I have developed in the past, these buttons are styled with the "transition" and "box-shadow" CSS attributes which allow for a smooth animation upon cursor hover.</p>
                <p>Finally, to enhance the aesthetics of the webpage, I set the "text-align" CSS attribute of the "page-content" class in order to center text throughout the body of the HTML files. In the index.html webpage I have leveraged the "text-orientation" and "writing-mode" CSS attributes in order to have the text with the "japanese-text" id flow downward instead of across the page in order to create a cultural layout that aesthetically aligns with Japanese typographic aesthetics in order to improve the overall user interaction.</p>
                <h3 class="comments-sub-title">Accessibility</h3>
                <p>The webpages are extremely accessible and anyone regardless of their disabilities can access and interact with the webpage as the use of contrasting colors including white and bright red text on dark blue background as a theme on my webpages allow for a user-friendly experience. The use of the clear, easy to read Verdana font and large text, especially on titles to emphasise different sections of my webpage also further emphasise its accessibility to anyone regardless of their disability. The webpages can also be accessed without using the mouse and only the keyboard by using keyboard shortcuts such as space to scroll down, shift+space to scroll up, shift and tab to change the focus to the next and previous link to different webpages and enter to "click" on these links.</p>
